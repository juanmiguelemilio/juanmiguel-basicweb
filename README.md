# Basic HTML Website

Create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages.

The goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML, focusing on different sections like the header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars, etc. Do not style the website; only focus on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.

## Project Requirements

You are required to create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages. The website should have the following pages:

The website should have a navigation bar that is present on all pages and links to all the pages.

## Goals of This Project

You can use the following mockup example to create the structure of the website (remember, you are not required to style the website; only focus on the structure that you can style later):
